# ng-svg

This is a simple angular.io application to learn how to interact with SVG elements in Angular. Think of it as an SVG playground. You can add a new component to the app as long as it uses SVGs, and ideally the code will be a useful reference. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, cd into the folder, and run `npm install` to grab dependancies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.
